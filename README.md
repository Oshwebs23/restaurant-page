# Restaurant Page

Welcome to the **Restaurant Page** repository! This project was created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The main goal is to build a restaurant website from scratch, applying skills in Webpack, modular JavaScript, and tabbed browsing for a smooth user experience.

## Project Overview

- **Single Page Application:** Navigate between different sections (Home, Menu, Contact) without full page reloads.
- **Tabbed Browsing:** Each section is displayed using tab navigation for seamless transitions.
- **Webpack Integration:** The project is bundled and managed using Webpack for efficient development and deployment.
- **Modular Design:** Code is organized in modules for maintainability and scalability.
